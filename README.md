# alookingglassintotheunconscious
The long way from K.G.Jung to contemporary polygraphists. The progress is evident, but maybe something important and essential is lost? Let's try to be clear and sort things out with Arduino. ***"Aha, a looking glass into the unconscious!" Carl Jung.***  If you have interest, Arduino board, some cheap components, patience to understand several simple but fundamental regularities, then you have the opportunity to have at your disposal no less impressive equipment and method, as Jung had.  THE STORY IS ABOUT SERIOUS LOOK TO ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY OF HUMAN SKIN – THE MOST POPULAR PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTION DURING MORE THAN 100 YEARS.

The scientific study of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) began in the early 1900-s. One of the first references to the use of EDA instruments in psychoanalysis is the book by C. G. Jung entitled Studies in Word Analysis, published in 1906. Jung and his colleagues used the galvanometer to evaluate the emotional sensitivities of patients to lists of words during word association. Jung was so impressed with EDA monitoring, he allegedly cried, "Aha, a looking glass into the unconscious!" Jung described his use of the device in counseling in his book, and such use has continued with various practitioners.

What was the methodology, and what was the hardware that Jung and his followers were working on? The first to discover the influence of mental conditions on the galvanometer was Professor Tarchanoff, who published a paper in Pflugers Archiv fur Physiologie, 1890, entitled “Galvanic Phenomena in the Human Skin in Connection with Irritation of the Sensory Organs and with Various Forms of Psychic Activity”. He employed tubular unpolarizable clay electrodes, connected with the skin by means of hygroscopic cotton pads, 10 to 15 cm long, saturated with saline solution. These are attached to a Meissner and Meyerstein galvanometer.
