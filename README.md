# a-looking-glass-into-the-unconscious
The long way from K.G.Jung to contemporary polygraphists. The progress is evident, but maybe something important and essential is lost? Let's try to be clear and sort things out with Arduino. ***"Aha, a looking glass into the unconscious!" Carl Jung.***  If you have interest, Arduino board, some cheap components, patience to understand several simple but fundamental regularities, then you have the opportunity to have at your disposal no less impressive equipment and method, as Jung had.  THE STORY IS ABOUT SERIOUS LOOK TO ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY OF HUMAN SKIN – THE MOST POPULAR PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTION DURING MORE THAN 100 YEARS.

The scientific study of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) began in the early 1900-s. One of the first references to the use of EDA instruments in psychoanalysis is the book by C. G. Jung entitled Studies in Word Analysis, published in 1906. Jung and his colleagues used the galvanometer to evaluate the emotional sensitivities of patients to lists of words during word association. Jung was so impressed with EDA monitoring, he allegedly cried, "Aha, a looking glass into the unconscious!" Jung described his use of the device in counseling in his book, and such use has continued with various practitioners.

What was the methodology, and what was the hardware that Jung and his followers were working on? The first to discover the influence of mental conditions on the galvanometer was Professor Tarchanoff, who published a paper in Pflugers Archiv fur Physiologie, 1890, entitled “Galvanic Phenomena in the Human Skin in Connection with Irritation of the Sensory Organs and with Various Forms of Psychic Activity”. He employed tubular unpolarizable clay electrodes, connected with the skin by means of hygroscopic cotton pads, 10 to 15 cm long, saturated with saline solution. These are attached to a Meissner and Meyerstein galvanometer.

Deviations of the mirror were noted through a telescope upon a scale three meters distant from the galvanometer. The scale was divided on each side of the zero point into 50 cm, and these again into mm. The galvanometer was so sensitive that a nerve-stream of a frog sciatic nerve deflected the mirror so much that all the divisions on the scale were passed over. The electrodes were applied at various times to different portions of the body, such as the hands and fingers, feet and toes, the face, the nose, the ears and the back.

Note that this was the time of pre-electronics and pre-computers. But we have some records of this time from the book of Jung.

Let's leave this for a moment and see what happened when the electronics came in. Look picture from Wikipedia (Electrodermal activity).

And a record from a modern polygraph:

Pretty similar, isn't it? Which is more accurate, which is more in line with reality? It turns out that it is not so easy to answer unequivocally to such a question. You have to try to understand the essence of things. But first - another record - now from my project using Arduino and Processing.

Again a similar, only as if clearer and more definite image. And now we will deal with the substance in great detail, and yet briefly.

First of all, the basic question arises. Is any of these 4 (Fig.3 - Fig. 6) pictures real? Does at least one of these pictures show what electrical processes take place on the skin under the electrodes? The answer is: clear and definite – no! And then, do we know in theory, and can we record practical what's going on there? The answer is – yes! The following picture shows my raw registration of EDA using an Arduino.
